            <p>I’m Shariq Ahsan and I’m running to be your next SFSS President. Over the last few years, I’ve had the privilege of leading and working with many executive teams. However, before that I started as a student who didn’t really know much about the SFSS or student groups around campus. Ever since getting involved 3 years ago I’ve worked to help students get access to all the resources that are provided by groups on campus. I recognize how hard it can be for many to get involved especially now in the current pandemic and I believe the SFSS has not helped to facilitate this process for its groups and students. If elected I will work to increase the awareness of the SFSS and get more students involved. I believe you do not need to be an executive to understand what is going on around campus. An engaged membership is a powerful membership!</p>
            <p>
            As SFSS president I want to begin to rebuild the trust that students have lost in the SFSS. This comes from being more accountable to your membership and ensuring that they are always consulted. This isn’t something that can be done overnight, and it will take a consistent effort to achieve. This effort has to start from our DSU’s and FSU’s. In order for them to tackle these challenges they need support from the SFSS and as President I will work to provide them with this. In doing this I hope to create more outreach initiatives on campus to better involve the membership. Student power is on the rise and now is the time to continue the push!</p>

          <h2>Experience</h2>

        </div>

          <p>Over the last few years I’ve been president of the Physics Student Association and then President of the Science Undergraduate Society. In those three years I’ve had the opportunity to lead diverse executive teams with there own set of challenges. As PSA President I was able to revamp the structure of the union and foster a greater sense of community. This was evident from seeing meeting attendance increase from 5-7 people per bi-weekly meeting to 25-30 people per biweekly meeting. With the turn to online learning there was a great fear among students of invasive proctoring software being used. As PSA President I negotiated a joint statement with the department in which they agreed to not pursue any invasive proctoring software. This greatly improved student mental health as it eased concerns about invasions of privacy. </p>
          <p>
          Last summer I also helped organize a joint campaign between the Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) and the Society of Arts & Social Sciences (SASS) to obtain common rooms in the new Student Union Building for both Faculty Student Unions. These spaces will serve as central hubs for the operations of both societies which will help foster a greater sense of community within these faculties. These rooms will serve as spaces for Science and Arts students to mingle between classes and interact, socialize, and network with students from other departments. After passing the motion to allocate space for these groups I worked alongside the VP Internal and Organizational Development and other executives from SUS and SASS to draft a memorandum of understanding between the SFSS and their respective faculties. In finalizing this agreement, we have ensured this community will be active for Science and Arts students for years to come. Over the last year I have also been a regular attendee of Council meetings and have gotten to hear the viewpoints of the many groups across campus.
